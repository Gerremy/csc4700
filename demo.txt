What is your favorite movie?
- Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
- Maybe California again.
If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
- I think for practicality sake, I would pick the ability to write and rewrite objective reality. Is this maybe one of those catch-all super powers that may be considered a lame response because you might as well say you can do everything and anything? ... maybe. But I'd pick that for a variety of reasons. Mainly because I'm indecisive. But besides that, you could rewrite any wrongful death, or any disease. Any world-scale issue can be rewritten to be something different and positive. You can use it selfishly to write and rewrite your own life, however you'd like. You can help out those you love with a hard time by making it not have ever happened, or by giving them something they'd need to get through that time. You can give yourself more time to do an assignment, or understand something in class. You can just outright write there to be world peace. You can make essentially every dream, goal, wish, desire, from small scale little ol' you to universal scale, happen. Of course, the flaw (cause every power has to have one) could be unintended consequences of your changes, dissatisfaction with controlled destiny, or bad intentions. But I'm sure I'd change the world for the better. And I'd make sure I have enough time, skills, and resources to do it.
